[Smartling Translation API](https://docs.smartling.com/display/docs/Smartling+Translation+API)
=================

This repository contains the Python sdk for accessing the Smartling Translation API.

The Smartling Translation API allows developers to seamlessly internationalize their website by automating the translation and integration of their site content.
Developers can upload resource files and download the translated file(s) in a locale of their choosing. There are options to allow for professional translation, community translation and machine translation.

And constructed with the following guidelines:
