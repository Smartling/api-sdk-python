File API sdk is ready to be used 'as is'.
All necessary files are in smartlingApiSdk.

Example.

Example script is placed in separate directory named 'example', and can't import from ../smartlingApiSdk, so minor tweak is done to add ../ to import path.
To run example just do:
cd example
python SmartlingApiExample.py


Test.

Test also can't import from ../smartlingApiSdk, so it also has ../ added to import path.
Also test use nose python framework.
Information about installing nose is here http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest.
Nose framework is used for test only and is not necessary for file API SDK to be used.
To run test do following:
cd test
nosetests testFAPI.py

Correct tests output looks like this:
