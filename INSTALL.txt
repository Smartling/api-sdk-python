File API sdk is ready to be used 'as is'.
All necessary files are in smartlingApiSdk.
So you could place directory smartlingApiSdk someplace in your project and use it as shown in example.

Example.

Example script is placed in separate directory named 'example'.
It should give you a examples of initializing API and using api calls.
To run example just do:
cd example
python SmartlingApiExample.py

Test.

Test uses nose python framework.
Information about installing nose is here http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest.
Nose framework is used for test only and is not necessary for file API SDK to be used.
To run test do following:
cd test
nosetests testFAPI.py

Correct tests output looks like this:
